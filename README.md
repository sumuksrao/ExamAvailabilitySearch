# Exam Availability Search

This is a Python script which runs and notifies the user if an exam availability pops up for given dates and location. This script also has the ability to enable Facebook Messenger notification, so a message can be sent to anyone as a notification aswell. This project was inspired when a friend tried to sign up for an exam, but all dates seemed to have been full and she was forced to check frequently for any last minute openings. This script was able to constantly check and notify her when an opening occured and she was able to take the exam.
